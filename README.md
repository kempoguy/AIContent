# Working Relationship Expectations (WRE) Builder

**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2024-11-07

## Overview

This repository provides a privacy-conscious, step-by-step process for creating your own Working Relationship Expectations (WRE) document. A WRE helps you engage more efficiently and effectively with AI tools (such as Copilot, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) by capturing your unique working, learning, and communication preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Read the Introduction**  
   Start with the Introduction file to understand what a WRE is and why it matters.

2. **Create Your WRE**  
   Use the WRE Builder script. Paste it into your preferred AI tool and answer the questions. For many, you can reply `default` to accept a recommended answer. For background or public links, provide your own input or skip.

3. **Use Your WRE with AI Tools**  
   Paste your completed WRE into any AI tool to help it adapt to your style and needs.

4. **Generate a User Manual (Optional)**  
   If you want to introduce yourself to colleagues or new contacts, use the User Manual prompt. Paste your WRE and the prompt into an AI tool to generate a friendly, shareable summary of your working style.

## Privacy & Safety

- Your WRE is for your use and the AI tool(s) of your choosing only.
- Never include confidential, sensitive, or private information.
- If you wish to reference your work or identity, use public links or descriptions only.
