2. The AI will ask you each question in sequence, in a conversational manner.
3. For many questions, you may reply **default** to accept the recommended answer. For questions about your background or public links, please provide your own input or skip.
4. At the end, the AI will assemble your answers into a draft WRE (version 1.0) for your review.
