# Prompt: Generate a User Manual from My WRE

I have created a Working Relationship Expectations (WRE) document using a structured process. Please read my WRE (attached or pasted below) and generate a “User Manual” that I can share with colleagues or new people I meet. The User Manual should:

- Be friendly, slightly formal, and conversational in tone.
- Summarise how I work, communicate, and collaborate, including my feedback style, preferences, and values.
- Highlight what others can expect from me, what I value in collaboration, and how to get the best from working with me.
- Include a brief summary of my professional background and public presence (if included in the WRE).
- Be clear, practical, and easy to read—aimed at helping others quickly understand how to work well with me.

If possible, organise the User Manual with clear headings and bullet points for readability.  
Do not include any confidential or sensitive information.

Here is my WRE:
