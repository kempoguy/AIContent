# Introduction to Working Relationship Expectations (WRE)

A **Working Relationship Expectations (WRE)** document is a private, structured resource that helps you engage more efficiently and effectively with AI tools (such as Copilot, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). It captures your unique working, learning, and communication preferences, so AI tools can adapt to your style and deliver more relevant, valuable support.

**Key Points:**
- Your WRE is for your use and the AI tool(s) of your choosing only.
- It should never be shared with others or published publicly.
- If accidentally published, it should not contain any information that could cause safety, privacy, or security concerns.
- Do not include confidential, sensitive, or private information. Use only public links or descriptions if referencing your work or identity.

**How to Use This Repo:**
1. Use the WRE Builder markdown script to create your WRE by answering the questions (defaults are available for most).
2. Use your WRE with any AI tool to get more personalised, effective support.
3. If you want to introduce yourself to colleagues or new contacts, use the User Manual prompt to generate a friendly, shareable summary based on your WRE.

*This process is designed for privacy, efficiency, and adaptability. Update your WRE as your working style or context evolves.*
